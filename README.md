Olympic Data Analysis
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Olympic data spanning multiple years and events. The dataset used contains information about athletes, countries, sports, and medals won during the Olympic Games. The aim was to extract insights, patterns, and trends from the data through exploratory analysis and visualization.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from [insert dataset source/link]. It includes details such as athlete names, countries, sports, events, and medal counts from various Olympic Games.

Tools and Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Jupyter Notebook
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Analysis
The analysis consists of several key components:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing trends in Olympic participation over the years, distribution of medals among countries and athletes, popular sports, etc.
Visualization: Creating visual representations (charts, graphs) to better understand the insights gained from the data.
Statistical Analysis: Conducting statistical tests, if applicable, to derive meaningful conclusions.
Findings
The analysis revealed several interesting findings, including:

Trends in the number of athletes participating in the Olympics over the years.
Dominant countries in terms of medal counts across different Olympic events.
Changes in the popularity of certain sports over time.
